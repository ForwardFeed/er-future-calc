# FUTURE CALC

Pokemon Calculators remade


## What is there to add?

- Better multiversionning, total modularity so client don't have to download everything as it is currently.
- Modern tooling, Typescript 2.1 was 10 years ago, a lot of workaround of back then aren't anymore
- UI made with vue, I love vue it's just better than basic html + js
- Possible integration of wasm, which supports better typing such as unsigned int for less problematic calculations
- Index Based calculation, no more string comparison, to allow better perfs, hence making possible
- Better UI, with more data grouping such as trainers's pokemon or trainer's team.
- conversion from gamecode of made games into data format for all romhacks and other kind of pokemons unofficial games.
- UI and calc must be headless, to allow for better UI to replace over time.
- 


## Some things I'd like to add

- sound effect on clicks, moreover on user interactions
